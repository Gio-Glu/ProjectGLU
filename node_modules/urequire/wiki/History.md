# v0.6.8 - (2013-12-02)

This release has many improvements, despite the 0.0.1 increase :-)
Not touching 0.7 issues yet, but workings are important towards 0.7 & 1.0 :-)

* New: [Merging of code sections of injected code in modules & bundles](resourceconverters.coffee#inject-any-string-before-after-body)

* New: ['useStrict', 'bare', 'globalWindow', 'runtimeInfo', 'allNodeRequires', 'noRootExports', 'scanAllow']

   * @derive = 'arrayPushOrOverwrite'

   * @type = 'booleanOrFilespecs'

* New: template.banner working for normal & `combined` template

* Fixed: `combined` template was confusing local dependencies's varNames, in some rare cases

* Improved/shorter reporting

* Documentation is lighter & more generic

  * splitting [tags-Legend] & [types-and-derive]

  * adding more subtle types

  * adding linkage

  * Ovehaul of [urequire.org](http://urequire.org) splash page

* Internal / Refactorings

  * Makeover of ModuleTemplate/AlmondTemplate with @sp & merging of sections

  * Generic code-manipulation related code, moved to /codeUtils (mainly from Module)

  * Dependency.type 'global' now called 'local'

  * More specs for isFileInSpecs

  * Dependency.type 'node' & isNode

  * RCs: throw when non-module has module flags + specs

  * Bundle: glob filters files only with **/*

  * Removed lodash dependency, used from _B._

# v0.6.7 - (2013-11-17)

  * build: useStrict, bare, globalWindow, runtimeInfo can be truthy or `filez` spec.

  * template: {combinedFile:'xxx'} works independently of `dstPath`, but each acts as default to the other if missing

  * `optimize` works for all templates, not only 'combined' ('uglify2' only).

# 0.6.6 - (2013-11-08)

 * Fixed [`build.globalWindow`](masterdefaultsconfig.coffee#build.globalWindow) is now using the enclosing IFI function to pass `window` or `global`, works well with "use strict" (but not with `build.bare`).

 * Change: nodejs template is `bare:false` by default.

# 0.6.5 - (2013-10-29)

  * Added [`build.useStrict`](masterdefaultsconfig.coffee#build.useStrict) & [`build.globalWindow`](masterdefaultsconfig.coffee#build.globalWindow) flags

# 0.6.4 - (2013-10-20)

  * Added 'UMDplain' template

  * revised root exports in UMD/AMD/nodejs templates

# 0.6.3 - (2013-10-19)

  * Added [`build.bare`](masterdefaultsconfig.coffee#build.bare) & [`build.runtimeInfo`](masterdefaultsconfig.coffee#build.runtimeInfo) flags

# 0.6.2 - (2013-10-01)

  * Added preliminary support for `srcMain` on RCs/FileResources.

  * Added working RC examples for `srcMain` - `execSync` (sync external processes) & `lessc` (LESS-to-css) - see [External-Processes](ResourceConverters.coffee#External-Processes).

  * Fixed bugs in RC.registry & cloning.

# 0.6.1 - (2013-09-26)

 * formally enabling & documenting `build.out`, as alternative to default `resource.save()`

# 0.6.0 - (2013-09-24)

* Module dependencies / factory extraction : 

 * new: esprima / Mozilla Parser AST is used for module information extraction. All functionality of ModuleManipulator/seekr is moved to Module, which is hugely refactored and improved.
 
 * new: Module has `replaceCode`, `beforeBody`, `afterBody`, `injectDeps`, `replaceDep` etc that alter the AST / dependencies (used in `isBeforeTemplate` ResourceConverters).

* ResourceConverters (`bundle.resources`): 

    * **Breaking from 0.4/0.5 ** The value of `this` in `convert()` is the RC instance, not the Resource/Module instance (which is passed as the 1st -and only- argument).
    
    * new: `isBeforeTemplate` '+' flag, passing a Module with extracted dependencies information and AST manipulation facilities, just BEFORE the template rendering.

    * new: search function can accept an Array or Function spec, returning a materialized and registered RC.

    * fixed: watching bug in refreshing `dstFilename` to `srcFilename` on touch.

* UMD/nodejs templates:    

    * fixed: 'module', 'export' being `require`d from nodejs instead of referenced.
    
    * fixed: #22 & #8, #5 due to coffee-* helpers outside `define()` not taken into account.

* 'combined' template has many new features, optimizations & bug fixes:  

    * new: structure for globals/dependency injections, saving from having `dependencies.exports.bundle` injected in each Module. Exported deps are available in the closure enclosing the modules, reducing size. 

    * new: AMD preDefineIFI statements are merged, saving space: the `combined.js` has only a single `__extends`, `__slice` etc from coffeescript, coco, Livescript etc, when AMD is used on source Modules in which case where the coffee-* compilers place these generated helpers outside the `define()`. Before 0.6, this was preventing using [AMD with coffee](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire/issues/8) or [Livescript](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire/issues/22) etc) because that code outside define() was not read. Now these helpers are merged into one to save space on the final `combined.js`!

    * fixed: factory() was a leak to global cause var was missing.

    * new: factory is passed globals as params


* Various:

    * Many refactorings, bug fixes and improvements on NodeRequirer, Module, Bundle, AlmondTemplates, watching, error handling, reporting, partial building, Dependency resolution, @property is gone (was error prone), using CalcCachedProperties from uBerscore 0.13 & more.

# 0.5.0 - (2013-08-10)

A revamp of `bundle: resources` & [Resource Converters](ResourceConverters.coffee) - they are much more useful and stable as an in-memory conversion pipeline.

**Breaking from 0.4.2 in ResourceConverter declarations :**

 - [ResourceConverter `convert()`](resourceconverters.coffee#inside-a-resource-converter) is called with just the `resource` instance as 1st argument and context (value of `this`). The instance holds all sorts of [useful information about its self](resourceconverters.coffee#filename-properties).

 - Helpers `copy`, `save` & `requireUncached` are available on the resource instances (passed to `convert()`). Also added `srcRealpath` & `dstRealpath` for `require`ing nodejs modules without worrying about relative paths.

 - `isTerminal:false` as default (instead of true) - use `"|"` flag for true.

 - `isModule` flag is gone - now `type` handle all types of [Resource Converters](ResourceConverters.coffee#resource-types:-the-type-field)

 - `dstFilename(filename)` changed to `convFilename(dstFilename, srcFilename)`. The resource still holds a `dstFilename` as the result of `convFilename()`.

 - Can search for registered RCs by name on `bundle:resources`, either as a plain string or a function that has the search function as its context (this).

# 0.4.2 - (2013-07-07)

Just bug fixing 

* `bundle.copy` where it belongs, working with arrayizePusher.

* dependencies bindings (eg `dependencies.exports.bundle`) derivation is much more robust.

# 0.4.1 - (2013-07-01)

* `bundle.resources` converters now have an `isAfterTemplate` field - allows you to run code transformations either BEFORE (default) or after template has been applied to each Module.

* Bug fixing & improved documentation.

# 0.4.0 - (2013-06-28)

`Watch`ing of builds is now an option:

* builds only changed files

* cache bundle & module info

* quickest possible (re)conversion

* suports partial builds & forces full build if needed (eg. 'combined' template)


Config format matures a lot (but still supports v0.3 fields as DEPRACATED):

  * `bundle.filez` works with minimatch (like grunt's `files`) & RegExps.

  * derivation is working properly & is documented better

More refactoring:

* Better handling of resources: BundleFile <- UResource <- UModule

* Improved error handling (UError, allowing nested errors & props) & debuging information.

* config blending (derive) is cleaner

# 0.3.0

v0.3.0 was never released, but gave way to 0.4 :-)

Huge code revamp, can easily be used by other libraries (check `urequireCMD.coffee` & [grunt-urequire](https://github.com/aearly/grunt-urequire)).

Improved debugging / warning / informational handling and output.

[combined template](combined-template) employing *r.js* & *almond* optimization

Configuration file with derivation appears.

# 0.2 

Refactoring, code documentation, more spec tests, plan for incorporating future functionality.

[AMD](amd-template) & [nodejs](nodejs-template) only module tranlation, through respective (buildin) templates.

[`rootExports`](exporting-modules#simplified-rootexports) & [`noConflict()`](exporting-modules#generated-noconflict-functionality) is declaratively offered.

Mimics the behaviour of RequireJS's `require(['dep1', 'dep2'], function(){})` where if dependencies 'dep1' & 'dep2' are already loaded (i.e cached), the factory function is called synchronously (immediatelly). **UPDATE: this feature is muted, to match RequireJS 2.1.x behaviour that fixed this.**


# v0.1.5 - v0.1.9

Working towards refactoring & loaderPlugins - node!, text! & json! are worked out (preliminary).

Support for native [RequireJS loader plugins](requirejs-loader-plugins) (like text! and json!).

# v0.1.0 - Alpha/preview release

A preview of what uRequire aims to become. Quite usefull as it is, but still a non-stable/Alpha.
