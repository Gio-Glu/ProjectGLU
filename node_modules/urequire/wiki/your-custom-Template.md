Creating your own custom templates is not APIized yet. But you can do it:

* Clone this project.

* Check [ModuleGeneratorTemplates.coffee](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire/blob/master/source/code/templates/ModuleGeneratorTemplates.coffee).

* Create your own one-to-one template as a method of `class ModuleGeneratorTemplates`.

* Add you template (method) name to [Build.templates](https://github.com/anodynos/uRequire/blob/master/source/code/process/Build.coffee) which currently *knows* only ['UMD', 'AMD', 'nodejs', 'combined'].

* PR you code or just build and install it globally & locally - you are set!

Note: 'combined' template is not really defined in `ModuleGeneratorTemplates.coffee`, since its more than just a one-to-one conversion.
