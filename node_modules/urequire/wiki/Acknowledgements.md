**Buidling on the shoulders of giants is always better.**

uRequire would not have been possible without :

  * [RequireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs), the most popular web-side module system to date, by [JR Burke](https://gist.github.com/jrburke)

  * [UMDjs](https://github.com/umdjs/umd), provide boilerplates that bridge gaps, by [JR Burke](https://gist.github.com/jrburke) and [others](https://github.com/umdjs/umd#umd-universal-module-definition)

  * [Esprima](http://esprima.org/), The high performance, standard-compliant ECMAScript parser written in JavaScript.

  * [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS), easily parses/re-generates JavaScript, by [Mihai Bazon](https://github.com/mishoo/)

  * [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/), makes javascript authoring a true joy, by [Jeremy Ashkenas](https://github.com/jashkenas) et [all](http://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script/contributors)

  * [Grunt](https://github.com/gruntjs), the best declarative javascript build system, by [Ben Alman](https://github.com/cowboy). Also, [urequire.org](http://urequire.org) web site is a cheap steal of gruntjs.com.

  * [Commander](https://github.com/visionmedia/commander.js), easily parses cmd arguments, by [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia)

and all others - see package.json dependencies.
