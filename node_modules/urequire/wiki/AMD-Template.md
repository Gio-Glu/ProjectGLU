### Converting to pure AMD module format

You can issue a `urequire AMD ...` or use `build:template:'AMD'` config option instead of the default uRequire UMD (Universal Module Definition) format.

The *AMD* template is safe & 100% equivalent for Web/AMD execution with its UMD counterpart (and smaller in size). Its also what you need to [r.js optimize](http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html) your package on your own (although you can save your self time & hassle and use the ['combined' template](combined-template) that does this for you).

If you want AMD along with simple nodejs execution consider 'UMDplain' template, which runs as Web/AMD & nodejs without any nodejs dependencies ([but has nodejs template limitations](nodejs-Template)).
