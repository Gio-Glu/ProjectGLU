* You can map web's root `/` to a directory of your nodejs environment (--webRootMap CMD option or [`webRootMap` in config](MasterDefaultsConfig.coffee#bundle.webrootmap)). The directory can be relative to bundle (paths starting with a `.`, eg `'../myWebRoot'`) or an absolute file system path (eg `'/dev/jslibs'`). Just make sure your Web Server has the right content mapped to `/` and you're set for both browser & nodejs!

* You can use the requirejs config `baseUrl` and `paths` on nodejs (only those for now) - just place a file named `requirejs.config.json` in your bundle root directory, with content like {"paths": {"myLib" : "../../myLib"}}. Very useful for 'importing' bundles, eg running specs against 'myLib' bundle using mocha, jasmine-node etc. Again, use the same config items on RequireJS/Web for transparent cross platform module usage.
